# A Universal React, Redux and ES6 Starter

A universal React, Redux and ES6 starter application.

Universal React and Redux starters are often complicated and annoyingly complicated to understand, this one shouldn't be.  It's bare bones and only has what it needs to have to work.  Reducers, actions and components have been left blank on purpose.
